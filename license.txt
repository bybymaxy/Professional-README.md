Professional-README.md
 I was getting tired of creating a readme and finding a template everytime i took on a new project. I then decided i needed a solution so I made a readme application in node js to        
autamate this step for myself to make my coding life easier.
 1. download the repo install proper json packages to ensure it works. 2. insure node.js is properly installed on your system. 3. run npm start or node index.mjs and it will  
prompt you to go through the quistions for creating your  README.md
 do npm start or node index.js and type in all your inputs and it will create a README.md for you.
 automating something that is usually trivial and requires you having a saved folder for copying over your readme template.
 Albert branom, and the xpert learning assistant helped allot.
